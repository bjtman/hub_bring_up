1) We first need to prepare a new sdcard. We do this by burning an image onto the card. Use the application named Etcher to create a new sd card. Currently using this image: https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.2-iot-armhf-2017-10-10-4gb.img.xz

Etcher can be found here: https://etcher.io/


2) Insert the new burned SD Card into a new Beagle Bone Black Wireless and connect the BBBW to your computer via USB cable

3) If the image was burned correctly, you will see a drive names BEAGLEBONE appear on your desktop. 

4) Open up a terminal and type the following:

ssh debian@192.168.7.2
debian@beaglebone:~$ sudo su

default password is: temppwd

5) Set up internet access (skip if you :

Setup Wifi Connection:

sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services

connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_....
Passphrase? <Enter password>

To check IP address

6) Enable UART 1

sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install git-core 

git clone https://github.com/beagleboard/bb.org-overlays
